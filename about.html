        <p>Hello! My name is Aniya Stanford, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
          at Kennesaw State University, with an expected graduation date in May 2026. Located in Atlanta, Georgia, I
          have a diverse range of experiences and skills in the IT field, driven by a passion for technology and
          cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the opportunity to intern at several organizations,
          where Iâ€™ve gained technical skills and practical experience.</p>
        <p>I am well-versed in a variety of technical skills, including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, C#, SQL, Python,
          and have foundational knowledge in cybersecurity. My core competencies include leadership, communication,
          problem-solving, teamwork, flexibility, time management, responsibility, and being results-oriented.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am actively involved in the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)
          and Kennesaw State University's chapter of NSBE, as well as the KSU Women in Technology organization.</p>
